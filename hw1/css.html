                had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I 
                wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and 
                Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its 
                lowest terms.” ― <span style="color: red">Henry David Thoreau (July 12, 1817 – May 6, 1862), Walden: Or, Life in the Woods</span></td>
